A Visual Studio Code theme inspired by Riskified's branding. This pack includes two themes:

*   **Riskified Dark Purple**: A variation with purple accents.

## Installation

1.  Open **Extensions** sidebar panel in VS Code. `View â†’ Extensions`
2.  Search for `Riskified Theme`.
3.  Click **Install** to install it.
4.  Click **Reload** to reload your editor.
5.  Code > Preferences > Color Theme > **Riskified Dark** or **Riskified Dark Purple**.
    (Or `File > Preferences > Color Theme` on Windows/Linux)

## Activating Theme

You can activate the theme through the command palette or your settings:

**Command Palette:**

1.  Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
2.  Type `Preferences: Color Theme` and select it.
3.  Choose either "Riskified Dark" or "Riskified Dark Purple" from the list.

**Settings:**

1.  Open your VS Code `settings.json` file.
2.  Set the `workbench.colorTheme` property to either `"Riskified Dark"` or `"Riskified Dark Purple"`:

    ```json
    {
      "workbench.colorTheme": "Riskified Dark"
    }
    ```
    or
    ```json
    {
      "workbench.colorTheme": "Riskified Dark Purple"
    }
    ```

## Screenshots

*(Coming Soon! Add screenshots of the themes in action here.)*

## Customization

If you wish to customize the theme further, you can do so by modifying your `settings.json` file. VS Code provides various settings to tweak the editor's appearance. For example, you can override specific theme colors:

```json
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "[Riskified Dark]": { // Or "[Riskified Dark Purple]"
      "editor.background": "#1E1E1E", // Example: Change background color
      "activityBar.background": "#252526"
    }
  },
  "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "[Riskified Dark]": { // Or "[Riskified Dark Purple]"
        "comments": "#55DD55" // Example: Change comment color
    }
  }
}
```
